# Golioth Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

## Installation

```console
npm install
```

## Local Development

```console
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment to Firebase Hosting

```console
npm run fb-deploy
```
## Versioning

In Ubuntu, the default npm install will not be up to date with the required npm packages. Consider using nvm to choose an LTS solution that will work better with Docusaurus V2.

* [nvm install for Ubuntu 20.04 (option 3)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04)
