title: Overview for virtual device Quickstart
---

:::caution
You must first follow the [Golioth Platform Quickstart](/docs/guides/golioth-platform-getting-started/platform-overview) before attempting this guide.
:::

This quickstart guide shows you how to build and test your system *without any hardware*. Take THAT, atoms! Software, FTW!

There are two paths for testing using virtual devices:
* Using the [`coap`](/docs/reference/coap/coap) command to send virtual responses to the platform
* Using QEMU (an emulator) to act like a piece of hardware would in the real world.
