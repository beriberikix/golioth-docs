In this guide we'll create an account with `goliothctl` but can also create an account via http://console.golioth.dev/. You can use the same account with the Console and `goliothctl` regardless of where you created it.

import SignUp from '../../partials/sign-up.md'

<SignUp/>

After the CLI is authenticated, we can move forward with provisioning a device.
