In this guide we'll create an account with `goliothctl` but you can also create an account via http://console.golioth.dev/. You can use the same account with the Console and `goliothctl` regardless of where it was created.

import SignUp from '../../partials/sign-up.md'

<SignUp/>

Once the CLI is authenticated, we can move onto provisioning a device.
