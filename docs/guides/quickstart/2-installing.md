title: Installing Goliothctl

`goliothctl` is a command-line utility that lets you work with Golioth, from creating your account to registering devices to interacting with _device services_ (more on those later.) It runs on your local machine so you'll want to install the version that's appropriate for your operating system:

import InstallTools from '../../partials/install-tools.md'

<InstallTools/>

### Package Managers

import ComingSoon from '../../partials/coming-soon.md'

<ComingSoon/>
