Golioth aspires to be device agnostic. Thanks to Zephyr's broad range of supported processors, modems and boards, Golioth is able to work with most designs. However, documenting every possible hardware combination would be nearly impossible. Instead, Golioth's documentation and samples focus on a few popular & well-tested hardware configurations. We call these "qualified devices." Over time will we add more qualified devices but we encourage the community to share their own configurations!
