:::note New to Golioth?
If you're new to Golioth we recommend you begin with the [Quickstart](../quickstart/1-getting-started.md). It will explain the fundamentals and help set up your build environment. It is also specifically built for the ESP32.
:::

### Install West and the Zephyr SDK

import SetupZephyr from '../../partials/setup-zephyr.md'

<SetupZephyr/>

### Install a device-specific toolchain

import SetupEsp from '../../partials/setup-esp.md'

<SetupEsp />

Your system is all set up and ready to start building & flashing with Zephyr. Verify by building a minimal sample:

```
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr
west build -b esp32 samples/basic/minimal
```
