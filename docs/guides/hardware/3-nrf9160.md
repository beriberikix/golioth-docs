### Installing west and Zephyr

Install west and zephyr as you would following the [Quickstart/Setup Zephyr](../../quickstart/setup-zephyr) guide but instead of pulling down
Golioth and initializing that, follow the these instructions:

1. Create a directory to download Zephyr and Golioth into, `zephyrproject` for example, and `cd` into it.

2. Pull down nRF's fork of Zephyr:

```
west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr v1.6.0
```

3. Run `west update`.

4. Add the following entry to `nrf/west.yml` in the `manifest/projects` subtree:

```yaml
# Golioth repository.
- name: golioth
  path: modules/lib/golioth
  revision: main
  url: git@github.com:golioth/zephyr.git
```

5. Now run `west update` again.

You should be good to go from this point.
