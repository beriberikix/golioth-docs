Billing on the Golioth platform is tied to organizations. Costs are accrued on a
monthly basis based on the tier of the organization and the usage of services
within projects in that organization. All billing information is managed via the
organization settings page, which can be accessed by hovering over an
organization in the navigation menu and selecting `Settings`.

:::tip
The navigation menu is accessed by clicking on the organization name in the
console header.

The organization `Summary` tab will display the tier of the organization and the
current payment status. To upgrade from the free tier (Individual) to a paid
tier, select `Upgrade Now`. To manage a subscription to a paid tier, select
`Manage Subscription`. In addition to changing subscription tier, the payment
portal allows for changing payment and contact information.

See the [Usage documentation](/reference/billing/usage) for more information on
understanding monthly usage. For more information on how usage translates to
costs, see [Golioth pricing](https://golioth.io/pricing).
