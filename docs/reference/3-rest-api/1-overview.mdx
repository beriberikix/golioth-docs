You can use Golioth API for access all services available on the platform, like device management, provisioning, data resources and others services to be build in the future.

#### API Usage

Our API is documented using OpenAPI definitions. You can access the [API Reference Page](/reference/rest-api/openapi) to check all endpoints and methods that can be used. A important aspect is authentication, that can be check on the [Authentication Guide](/reference/rest-api/auth).

#### Importing OpenAPI/Swagger definitions

You can test Golioth API using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) like Postman or Insomnia. Here are some links on how to import Open API definitions using those projects. For the Swagger file URL, you can use <SwaggerUrl/> url to import our API definitions.
