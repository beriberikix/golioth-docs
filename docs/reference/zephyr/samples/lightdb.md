title: Golioth Light DB sample
---

# Overview

This Light DB application demonstrates how to connect with Golioth and
access Light DB.

# Requirements

-   Golioth credentials and server information
-   Network connectivity

# Building and Running

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your Golioth
credentials and server in your own overlay config file:

-   GOLIOTH_SERVER_IP_ADDR - Server IPv4 address.
-   GOLIOTH_SERVER_PORT - Server port number.
-   GOLIOTH_SERVER_DTLS_PSK_ID - PSK ID of registered device
-   GOLIOTH_SERVER_DTLS_PSK - PSK of registered device

## Platform specific configuration

### QEMU

This application has been built and tested with QEMU x86 (qemu_x86) and
QEMU ARM Cortex-M3 (qemu_cortex_m3).

On your Linux host computer, open a terminal window, locate the source
code of this sample application (i.e., `samples/lightdb`) and type:

``` {.console}
$ west build -b qemu_x86 samples/lightdb
$ west build -t run
```

See [Networking with
QEMU](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/networking/qemu_setup.html#networking-with-qemu)
on how to setup networking on host and configure NAT/masquerading to
access Internet.

### ESP32

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your WiFi AP
credentials:

-   ESP32_WIFI_SSID - WiFi SSID
-   ESP32_WIFI_PASSWORD - WiFi PSK

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `samples/lightdb`) and type:

``` {.console}
$ west build -b esp32 samples/lightdb
$ west flash
```

This is the overlay template for WiFi credentials:

``` {.console}
CONFIG_ESP32_WIFI_SSID="my-wifi"
CONFIG_ESP32_WIFI_PASSWORD="my-psk"
```

See
[ESP32](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/xtensa/esp32/doc/index.html)
for details on how to use ESP32 board.

## Sample overlay file

This is the overlay template for Golioth credentials and server:

``` {.console}
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SERVER_DTLS_PSK_ID="my-psk-id"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SERVER_DTLS_PSK="my-psk"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SERVER_IP_ADDR="192.168.1.10"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SERVER_PORT=5684
```

## Sample output

This is the output from the serial console:

``` {.console}
[00:00:00.010,000] <wrn> net_sock_tls: No entropy device on the system, TLS communication may be insecure!

[00:00:00.040,000] <inf> golioth_lightdb: LED 0 -> 1
```

## Monitor counter value

Device increments counter every 5s and updates `/counter` resource in
Light DB with its value. Current value can be fetched using following
command:

``` {.console}
goliothctl lightdb get <device-id> /counter
```

## Control LEDs

Multiple LEDs can be changed simultaneously using following command:

``` {.console}
goliothctl lightdb set <device-id> /led -b '{"0":true,"1":false,"2":true,"3":true}'
```

This request should result in following serial console output:

``` {.console}
[00:00:04.050,000] <dbg> golioth_lightdb: Payload
                                          a4 61 33 f5 61 30 f5 61  31 f4 61 32 f5          |.a3.a0.a 1.a2.

[00:00:04.050,000] <inf> golioth_lightdb: LED 0 -> 1
[00:00:04.050,000] <inf> golioth_lightdb: LED 1 -> 0
[00:00:04.050,000] <inf> golioth_lightdb: LED 2 -> 1
```

Additionally board LEDs will be changed, if they are configured in
device-tree as:

-   `/aliases/led0`
-   `/aliases/led1`
-   `/aliases/led2`
-   `/aliases/led3`
