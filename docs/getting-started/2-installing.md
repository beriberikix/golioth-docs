### Download Pre-built CLIs

You can download the latest tools on the [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/golioth/golioth/releases). Binaries are available for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Building from source (Maintainers Only)

You need [Go](https://golang.org) installed on your system. We recommend using Go 1.15 to build from source.

Clone the [golioth](https://github.com/golioth/golioth) repository from Github.

Them run the command `make install` on the root folder to install the `goliothd`, [goliothctl](/docs/goliothctl/goliothctl) and [gurl](/docs/gurl/gurl) command line tools.
