Let's use the Golioth Console to create a new device.

In the center at the top of the console widow the currently selected project is shown. On the left sidebar we can use the Management&rarr;Devices option to list this project's devices. Here we see the device that was created by the quickstart wizard.

* Click the Create button in the upper right to create a new device.

* Enter a Name and click save to create the device.

Before your newly created device can communicate with the Golioth Cloud it will need to be assigned credentials using the device authorization process.
