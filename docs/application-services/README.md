Golioth Application Services are hosted offerings that are integrated into the
Golioth platform, making it simple and straightforward to use them alongside
other product offerings. Leveraging Golioth Application Services removes the
overhead of creating accounts on other platforms, managing external credentials,
and monitoring spend across mutliple vendors.
