The best way to get started with Pipelines is to take an example and modify it
to fit your use case. This section contains a set of example pipelines along
with explanations of their functionality.

:::usage
Many examples incur usage costs after exceeding the free tier. See [Golioth
pricing](https://golioth.io/pricing) for more information.

## Share Your Pipelines

You can click the share button next to a pipeline in the console to copy a
shareable link like the `Use this Pipeline` links in this section. Golioth users
who click on the link can open a pipeline identical to your's in their own
project.

:::warning
You should make sure that any sensitive values included in a shared pipeline are
stored in referenced [secrets](/data-routing/secrets). This not only avoids
leaking sensitive data, but also makes it easier for other users to provide
their own secret values when using your pipeline.
:::

If you have a pipeline that you think should be included in these examples,
post it on the [Golioth forum](https://forum.golioth.io/).
