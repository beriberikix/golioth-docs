## Firmware

The Golioth firmware version is dependent upon the Device SDK you are using. Our first SDK is built on top of Zephyr

## Terminology

* Software Development Kit (SDK) - This is a package of firmware and software that contains everything needed in order to run a simple program, such as "hello world". 
* Sample - This is a discrete application, often showcasing one element of the Golioth system (ie. [LightDB set](/firmware/zephyr-sdk/samples/lightdb/set))
