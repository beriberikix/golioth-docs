The DFU sample demonstrates the capability of the Golioth DFU service from the perspective of the device.  The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the sample within the Device SDK architecture. The components of the DFU service are described in the Introduction document. The elements of the sample will be described in more detail in the DFU Sample Guide. The DFU sample respository can be found [here](https://github.com/golioth/zephyr-sdk/tree/main/samples/dfu).
