The first requirement of the service is creating device credentials. This procedure is available in the Getting Started Guide. The goliothctl command line tool interacts with the golioth console to create a virtual device.  Virtual device credentials in this sample are applied to the embedded device via the proj.conf file.  This credential configuration method is common to all Golioth service reference code.
