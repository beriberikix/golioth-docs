If you have already worked through the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.golioth.io/getting-started) to create device credentials, there is more information regarding device authentication available in the [Authorizing Devices](https://docs.golioth.io/getting-started/authorize-devices) section.  After credentials are entered into the configuration file, there is no further direct interaction with the credentials.  Credentials will be handled by the Golioth System Client in the background.
