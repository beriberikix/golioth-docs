Webhook are a simple and flexible way to receive events from Golioth platform using HTTP. Is really easy to build a web server to receive those events and you can write you own logic to process them.

### Webhook Specific Attributes

For each Output Stream type, there is a set of specify attributes. Here are the ones for Webhooks:

| Attribute | Type   | Required | Description                                         |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| uri       | string | âœ…       | URI where events are gonna be send via POST request |
| headers   | object |          | Extra HTTP headers to be send                       |

### Example

As mentioned on [Output Streams Overview](/cloud/output-streams), events are send using [Cloud Events](https://cloudevents.io) format. For Webhook specifically, some metadata of the event are sent as HTTP headers.

Here is an example of a event arriving on a webhook. Headers prefixed with `Ce-` are related to Cloud Events and the message body is the event payload ( see event payloads on [Output Streams Event Types](/cloud/output-streams/event-types/events) ).

```
