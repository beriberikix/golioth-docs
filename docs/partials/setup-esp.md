#### Install Espressif SDK (ESP-IDF)

You can also follow the [Getting started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.2/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step) from Espressif docs website and install their build tools and SDK.

After installing Espressif's tool, there is a [guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/xtensa/esp32/doc/index.html) on Zephyr's website for settings up the correct environment variables to be able to build project targeting an ESP32.
