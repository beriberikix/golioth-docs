You can simulate a device to test the Golioth Cloud without the need for additional hardware. Virtual devices use the same provisioning steps as any other device, and are a good way to verify you have correctly set the device credentials. They are also a valuable tool in testing the lightDB and lightDB stream schemas that you plan to use with your hardware.
