title: Flashing Overview

There are two main options for flashing code to nRF9160 boards:

1. [Using a USB bootloader](bootloader)
2. [Using a hardware programmer](hardware-programmer)

This section will discuss how to set up and use both of these. Anyone working with boards like the [Circuit Dojo nRF9160 Feather](/hardware/catalog/boards/quickstart/arm_circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160), the [nRF9160 DK](/hardware/catalog/boards/quickstart/arm_nrf9160dk_nrf9160), or the Thingy:91 will find this information useful.
